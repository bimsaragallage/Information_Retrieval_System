Lemon Icebox Pie – is a silky smooth, light and fluffy, rich and creamy pie overflowing with vibrant lemon flavor. A chilled dessert that’s such a tempting treat on a warm day!
Decadent lemon pie made with a crisp graham cracker crust, a sweet and tangy, cream cheese infused, fresh lemon filling, and it’s garnished with dollops of fluffy and clouds whipped cream atop.
It is similar to a key lime pie but no eggs required. This pie is truly a lemon lovers delight!
Why You’ll Love This Lemon Pie
No bake option: This simple to make pie can also become a no-bake treat if you opt to go the route of a no-bake crust.
Versatility: You can also swap the crust out for various other cookie bases such as using vanilla wafers, biscotti cookies or gingersnaps. You could also make and almond flour type crust.
Then for the filling you may also opt to use lime juice and zest in place of lemon.
Storage life: It keeps well in the fridge for several days and this lemon icebox pie can even be frozen.
Lemon Icebox Pie Recipe Ingredients
Graham crackers: Use the traditional honey graham crackers here. You’ll need about 9 full size sheets (rectangles) or 18 halves (squares).
White sugar and powdered sugar: The granulated white sugar is used in the crust while the fine powdered sugar is used in the filling and whipped cream for smoothness.
Salt: Just a hint of salt is added to the pie to balance the sweetness and highlight the tartness.
Unsalted butter: Salted butter may be used in its place just omit salt from the recipe.
Lemons: Use only fresh lemons here (for the juice and zest), not bottled juice or the flavor won’t be near as good. It’s the main flavor of the pie so we want to use the best quality.
Cream cheese: Use well softened cream cheese so the pie isn’t lumpy.
Sweetened condensed milk: For best results stick with the full fat option for richness.
Gelatin: This is a key ingredient to the pie. I attempted making it several times without but the slices never held up and were always droopy. Just a little bit of gelatin makes a big difference in setting the pie.
Heavy cream: Look for “heavy cream” or “heavy whipping cream”, it whips up the best. Also for an extra decadent pie you can always add more than is shown.
Vanilla extract: A flavoring ingredient used in both the filling and topping for light flavor enhancement.
Natural food coloring gel: This ingredient is completely optional. Without it the pie is more of a beige color just not so lemony yellow. I use a few drops of yellow and a fint touch of red for a nice hue.
How to Make a Graham Cracker Crust
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a mixing bowl whisk together graham cracker crumbs, granulated sugar, and salt. Pour in butter and toss with a fork until evenly moistened.
Press mixture firmly into a 9-inch glass pie plate (standard size, not deep dish). You can use the bottom of a flat measuring cup to help press even.
Bake in preheated oven 10 minutes. Let cool completely on a wire rack until adding filling or it will melt.
How to Make Lemon Pie Filling
Add 2 Tbsp of the lemon juice to a small microwave safe mixing bowl, sprinkle gelatin over and whisk immediately. Let rest 5 minutes.
Meanwhile in a large mixing bowl using an electric hand mixer set on medium-high speed whip cream cheese until smooth and nicely fluffy for 3 minutes, scrape down bowl.
Heat gelatin mixture in the microwave on high power for 15 seconds or until gelatin is dissolved. Remove and whisk for 15 seconds (be ready to proceed to next step soon or gelatin mixture it will start to set as it cools).
To cream cheese add sweetened condensed milk, remaining lemon juice (6 Tbsp), lemon zest, vanilla extract and a few drops of natural yellow color (with a faint dot of red if you want a more natural lemon-like tone).
Blend mixture on medium speed until well combined, scrape down bowl.
While mixing with mixer on medium speed pour gelatin mixture into cream cheese mixture and blend until evenly combined.
Pour mixture into cooled graham cracker crust and spread even.
Transfer to fridge and let chill until set, at least 4 hours.
Once set top with the sweetened whipped cream (by spooning over dollops on individual slices or decorating edges of pie with whipped cream piped from a piping bag with a star tip).
Storing Lemon Icebox Pie
Fridge: Lemon icebox pie will keep well in the fridge for 3 days (covered). Don’t cover with aluminum foil over the top or it will taste metallic.
Freezer: Another option is to freeze the pie for up to 3 months in a sealed container. Thaw overnight in the fridge before serving.
Helpful Tips for the Best Lemon Pie
Fresh lemon flavor: The very best way to prepare a lemon pie is with fresh lemon juice and zest. Skip the bottled juice and dried zest.
Fluffy pie: Whip the cream cheese with the beaters first for a light and airy pie.
Smooth filling: For the smoothest pie use well softened cream cheese. Also scrape the bowl using a spatula occasionally as you blend for even mixing.
No Bake Pie Crust Option: For a faster, completely no-bake option you can skip baking the crust and simply set it in the freeze for 15 minutes while you prepare the filling.
