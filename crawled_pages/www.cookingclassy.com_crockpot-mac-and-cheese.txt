Crockpot Mac and Cheese – It’s made with hearty elbow macaroni and over a pound of three cheeses! It’s rich and satisfying and one of the ultimate comfort food side dishes.
Easy Crockpot Mac and Cheese!
This is hands the absolute easiest way to make macaroni and cheese! Believe it or not, it’s unbelievably creamy, no broken curdled sauce, no mushy noodles, and the taste is simply perfect.
My tricks to a good crockpot mac and cheese are to use a combination of cream, water, and evaporated milk – instead of regular or whole milk so it doesn’t curdle in the cheese sauce. Then also wait until closer to the end to add the shredded cheese so that doesn’t overheat and separate.
And another important key is to use a combination of cheeses for great flavor and texture. Sharp cheddar builds up the best traditional macaroni and cheese flavor, while each American cheese and Monterey Jack cheese create a velvety sauce.
The starches of cooking everything together in one pot (or slow cooker insert technically) also help create a smooth sauce.
This is a family favorite! It has a well-balanced flavor that isn’t too harsh so people of all ages love it, and the cook will love the ease of preparation.
It’s jam-packed flavorful goodness in every bite and undoubtedly worthy of the holidays (it’s perfect for Thanksgiving, Christmas, or potlucks), but yet simple enough for a weeknight side dish!

Crockpot Macaroni and Cheese Recipe Ingredients
Dry macaroni pasta
Butter
Water
Evaporated milk
Heavy cream
Onion powder and garlic powder (try paprika if you like some spice!)
Salt and black pepper
Sharp cheddar cheese (shredding it yourself tastes better, but pre-shredded cheeses are faster)
American cheese (from the deli)
Monterey Jack cheese
How to Make Crockpot Mac and Cheese
Spray a 5 to 6-quart slow cooker with non-stick cooking spray.
Add macaroni pasta, butter, water, evaporated milk, heavy cream, onion powder, garlic powder and season with salt to taste. Stir then level and submerge pasta in liquid as best you can.
Cover and cook on low heat until macaroni is about 2/3 of the way tender, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours.
Working quickly remove lid and add cheddar, American cheese and Monterey Jack cheese. Stir then quickly return lid.
Cook covered 15 to 30 minutes longer until pasta is tender and cheese is melted.
Stir. Thin with a little hot water as needed. Season with pepper to taste if desired.
Possible Substitutes and Variations
Velveeta option: While it won’t taste quite as good you could substitute Velveeta for the deli American cheese if that’s what you have on hand.
Toasted breadcrumb topping: A delicious addition to this is to finish it with toasted panko breadcrumbs. To do this melt 3 Tbsp butter in a skillet over medium heat, add 1 1/2 cups panko breadcrumbs. Toss almost constantly until toasty and golden brown. Serve over finished mac.
Stronger cheese flavor: For bolder flavor use extra sharp cheddar in place of sharp cheddar, or replace Monterey Jack cheese with Gruyere, or you can even add a little finely shredded parmesan cheese (shred with a zester).
Extra creamy sauce: If you want it even creamier then replace 1/3 cup of the water with an additional 1/3 cup heavy cream.
Make it spicy: Add some red pepper flakes or cayenne pepper to taste.
Helpful Tips
Use freshly grated cheeses: We don’t want the additives that are included in pre-grated cheeses here. The flavor won’t be as good or the texture.
Brands of macaroni to use: I’ve made this recipe with several brands and we preferred Barilla. It’s a bit larger and holds up a little better and doesn’t seem to release as much starch as others.
Slow cooker brand cook time: Note that every brand and model of slow cooker will cook at a different rate. For this recipe I use Crockpot brand slow cookers and they are known to cook high. If you have a different brand you will likely need to cook toward greater times listed and possibly even a little more.
Be careful not to over-stir: And stir gently. This is once pasta is partial cooked, then when stirring in cheeses and at the end. Just a few good quick stirs each time so it doesn’t mash the macaroni and get overly starchy.
Keeping mac and cheese warm: You can keep the macaroni and cheese set on the warm setting of the slow cooker for up to 30 minutes after cook time is complete. Keep it covered with a lid. Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator and reheat in the microwave.
Serving Suggestions
I recommend serving this with:
Baked chicken thighs
Roasted chicken
Buttermilk roast chicken
Grilled chicken with homemade BBQ sauce
Grilled corn on the cob
Roasted broccoli or steamed broccoli
Roasted vegetable blend

Thank you for this recipe! I love the taste of the cheese combination! I followed all of your directions and it came out so yummy! Can I do the same recipe on the stove? Wondering if you ever tried it thank you so much!

It should work on the stovetop as well over a low heat you may just need a bit more liquid possibly. I’m happy you liked it!

I just made a test batch and it came out really good.  Can this recipe be doubled easily.
March 16, 2024Reply
Jaclyn
It should double well, the cook time may just need to be increased slightly but shouldn’t be by much. I’m glad you liked it Nancy!

I don’t understand the cheese measurements listed as there are 8 ounces in a cup It say 10oz of cheddar shredded(2 1/2 cups)??????? That would actually be 20 ounces. The American and Monterey Jack both say 4 ounces(1 cup) but that would actually only be half a cup of each. I’m confused.

Cheese measures a bit different by volume (when shredded there’s lots of empty space when put in a measuring cup it’s not a whole solid).

I never thought about that but it makes perfect sense. That’s why you have a recipe site and I do not…lol I’m planning on making this for Easter.

It didn’t make sense to me at first either. :) I hope you enjoy this! Happy Easter!

I have made this recipe multiple times and it always turns out great. I have made it exactly following the recipe and also substituting different cheeses and sometimes using 2% milk instead of the cream for a little lighter taste.  No matter what I’ve done it is always a bit hit and everyone wants seconds! Thank you for a wonderful recipe!
