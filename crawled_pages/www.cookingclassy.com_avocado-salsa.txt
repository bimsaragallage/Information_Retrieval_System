Flavorfully fresh Avocado Salsa – Made with creamy avocados, bright tomatoes, crisp onions, herby cilantro and a bright lime dressing. It’s the ultimate tortilla chip dip or main dish topping!
This simple avocado salsa is basically guacamole mingled with salsa or pico de gallo. It’s a dip that has the flavors of guacamole but more of a texture similar to a chunky salsa.
It’s brimming with nutritious ingredients, and you’ll love it’s lively flavor. Plus who can resit that tempting blend of textures? Among them a soft bite, bits of crispness throughout, plenty creaminess, and with crunchy flakey chips a truly perfect pairing.
It’s a fine-chop dunk-able chip dip, or you can use it as a topping over cooked protein such as pan seared salmon, black bean burgers, or grilled chicken. Another option of course is to heavily layer it over your favorite Mexican food – things like taco salad, chicken street tacos, fajitas, or even add a few spoonfuls to a bowlful of tortilla soup.
I think you’ll really come to appreciate all the various ways you can enjoy this salsa!
It’s perfectly fitting for weeknight dinner meals and always a crowd pleasing appetizer at parties! People will say it’s a welcome upgrade to classic salsa, and for you it may become a go-to way to use up those ever so delicious avocados.
Avocado Salsa Ingredients
For this guacamole salsa recipe, you’ll need:
Avocados: These are the most important ingredient in the salsa so look for the best you can find.
Tomatoes: I recommend sweet Roma tomatoes for this recipe.
Red onion: If needed you can substitute yellow onion or white onion.
Jalapeño:
Cilantro: If you have an aversion to cilantro and it has that soap bitter taste to your tastebuds then try it with parsley instead.
Lime juice:
Olive oil:
Garlic:
Salt and pepper:
How to Make Salsa with Avocados
Prep the veggies (seed and dice the tomatoes, cube the avocado, etc).
Place the avocado salsa ingredients in a large bowl.
Pour dressing over the salsa and toss to combine.
Serve with chips or favorite Mexican entree.
Frequently Asked Questions
Can I Make It in Advance?
If you want to prep most of it in advance that is a good option, just store in the fridge then wait to add the avocado until you are ready to serve it for the best results.
Does Avocado Salsa Keep Well as Leftovers?
Depending on the batch of avocados it may last for a a day or two in the fridge if stored in an airtight container. Over time the tomatoes will release more juice, and keep in mind that the avocado may likely begin to brown a bit.
Can I Add More Vegetables to This Salsa?
Of course! Grilled corn is another great veggie to add to this avocado salsa, or try it with peppers such as Anaheim, poblano, or bell peppers. Even a few radishes would be a welcome addition.
Is Using Canned Tomatoes an Option?
I only recommend fresh tomatoes for this avocado salsa. Canned tomatoes are too juicy and soft for this recipe, plus they’d bleed and discolor the salsa.
Tips for the Best Homemade Salsa
Use just ripe avocados that are fairly firm but nicely ripened in flavor, otherwise you’ll just end up with a mushy paste with chunks of tomatoes.
If you aren’t a fan of spicy foods you can omit the jalapeños. And if you like it spicier you can leave in the ribs and seeds in or even use hotter peppers like serrano or habanero.
Seeding the tomatoes is very important, otherwise a lot of liquid collects at the bottom of the bowl.
Chop ingredients very small since this is a dip or condiment. You don’t want it overly chunky.

Bright and zesty avocado salsa! Loaded with flavor and color. Perfect as a dip or topping over a main dish.
Servings: 8
Prep15 minutes minutesReady in: 15 minutes minutes
Ingredients6 medium (20 oz) roma tomatoes (20 oz), seeded and diced 1 cup chopped red onion, diced1 large or 2 small jalapeños, seeded and diced (1/4 cup. Leave ribs and seeds if you like heat)3 medium avocados, semi-firm but ripe, peeled, cored and diced3 Tbsp olive oil3 Tbsp fresh lime juice1 clove garlic, finely minced1/2 tsp salt (more or less to taste as desired)1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper1/2 cup loosely packed cilantro leaves, minced
InstructionsPlace red onion in a strainer or sieve and rinse under cool water to remove harsh bite. Drain well. Add to a mixing bowl along with diced tomatoes, jalapeños and avocados.In a separate small mixing bowl whisk together olive oil, lime juice, garlic, salt and pepper until mixture is well blended. Pour mixture over avocado mixture, add cilantro then gently toss mixture to evenly coat. Serve with tortilla chips or over Mexican entrees.
Notes
If you aren't a fan of spicy food you can replace jalapeños with diced bell pepper. If you'd like it spicier you can leave the ribs and seeds of the jalapeños or even use a hotter pepper like one serrano or habanero pepper.
This salsa is best served within a few hours of preparing as the avocado may start to brown. If you'd like to prepare it in advance just toss everything together except the avocado then store in the fridge for a few days, then add the avocados when ready to serve.
