What is Barbacoa?
Barbacoa is an authentic Mexican dish typically made with beef, goat or lamb. It is traditionally seasoned with dried chilies and spices and slowly cooked until perfectly tender. From there it’s used as a delicious filling for tacos, burritos and so forth.
Barbacoa Beef Video
This is my favorite Barbacoa Beef recipe! I first shared the recipe back in April 2015 but have since decided those photos needed some updating.
It’s an easy to make dish, nothing complicated and it doesn’t use hard to find ingredients. It’s incredibly flavorful and you’ll love the brightness of the lime.
Most definitely a recipe easily worthy of your dinner rotation!

Ingredients for Barbacoa Beef
Chuck roast – this type of roast is best here with it’s fat marbling. It yields super tender results.
Vegetable oil – this is used for browning the roast.
Beef broth – chicken broth can be substitute here if that’s what you have.
Chipotle chilis – these add a tasty spicy kick. Freeze any remaining from the can for a later use.
Garlic – as always I only recommend fresh garlic.
Cumin, cloves, oregano, bay leaves – these spices and herbs add a delicious depth of flavor.
Salt and pepper – season with a fair amount of each so it doesn’t taste flat.
Fresh lime juice – some barbacoa recipes call for vinegar but I like the fresh lime much better here.
How to Make Barbacoa Beef
Portion beef: Cut roast into 6 portions while removing any large pieces of fat.
Brown portions: Heat oil in skillet and sear seasoned beef, half at a time, until browned on all sides.
Make chili paste: In a food processor, pulse together chipotle chilies, garlic and 1/4 cup beef broth until well pureed.
Make barbacoa sauce: Whisk together remaining beef broth with chipotle mixture, cumin, oregano, salt, pepper and cloves.
Add beef and mixtures to slow cooker: Pour mixture over beef in slow cooker, add bay leaves.
Cook in Crockpot low and slow: Cover and cook on low heat 8 – 9 hours.
Shred beef: Remove beef from slow cooker (leave broth) and shred.
Mix in lime and rest to soak flavors: Stir lime juice into broth in slow cooker then return beef to slow cooker and cook on low or warm 20 – 30 minutes longer.
Can I Cook on High Heat in the Slow Cooker?
High heat cooking is not recommend here, the beef won’t be as tender so stick with low and slow.
How to Make it More Mild?
If you don’t want the kick of the chipotle peppers simply use 4 tsp chili powder instead. Also, skip the food processor step, just mince garlic instead.

Notes
*If you don't like spicy food replace chipotle chiles with 4 tsp mild chili powder instead.
** I don't recommend cooking on high heat for this recipe, low cooking will achieve the most tender results.

Wow! Just wow! This was delicious! Followed the recipe except used a little chipotle powder (1/4 tsp) instead of the canned peppers to make a little milder. I will definitely be making this again and again! Thanks for sharing a great recipe.

I’ve made this very tasty recipe half a dozen times. Delicious and simple to cook, thanks to the easy to follow instructions & video. Four Chipotle chillies gives it a nice spicy kick.  Freezes and reheats great too. Excellent for taco’s, quesidillas and on rice. Thank you so much for sharing Jaclyn!

Read the Notes> If you don’t like heat then sub mild chili powder instead. Also, you can make any recipe to your liking. Add whatever you like leave out or sub out what you don’t like.
