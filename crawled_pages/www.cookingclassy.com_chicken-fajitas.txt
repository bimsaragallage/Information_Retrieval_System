Chicken Fajitas – This easy, restaurant quality recipe is made with deliciously seasoned chicken, a trio of fresh bell peppers and tender crisp onions all served atop warmed tortillas. It’s a family favorite recipe we’ve used countless times over!
Want to make the best fajitas ever? Then be sure to serve with my homemade flour tortillas if time allows (prep while the chicken marinates). Easily worth the extra bit of effort!
Easy Homemade Chicken Fajitas
Chicken fajitas are most commonly made with chicken breasts but chicken thighs are the best, and this is my tested and perfected recipe I’m so happy to share with you!
Chicken is soaked in a seasoned, lime and oil based marinade then pan seared in a hot cast iron skillet to achieve a flavorful charred exterior with crisped edges, and juicy, tender interior.
After which fresh multi-color bell peppers, and boldly flavored onions and garlic are sautéed to a perfect tender crisp texture in the same piping hot skillet.
Then to assemble fajitas chicken is sliced, and mounded over flour tortillas along with those flavorful veggies.
It’s a restaurant favorite, classic Tex-Mex recipe you’ll never want to lose!
Chicken Fajitas Recipe Ingredients Plus Possible Substitutes
Chicken thighs or chicken breasts: If using chicken breasts pound thicker portions more even so thinner areas don’t cook faster and dry.
Olive oil: This is used in the marinade and for sautéing (don’t use extra-virgin or it will burn at this temp). Vegetable oil may be substituted.
Lime juice: Only use freshly squeezed lime juice, bottled would ruin the flavor. Though not traditional in a pinch lemon could be substituted.
Garlic: Use freshly mined for best flavor. You can sub bottled fresh it’s just not quite as bold.
Chili powder: use a good quality chili powder, and not hot unless you want it spicier. You could try other types like ancho or mild New Mexican chili powder.
Cumin: This spice adds a delicious earthy flavor. If you happen to be out coriander is another delicious option.
Jalapeno: Use this if you like a little heat. You can also sub a 1 – 2 canned chipotle chilies.
Salt and pepper: The marinade is well seasoned so be sure to stir well to distribute salt evenly.
Bell peppers: Go for three different colors to make the dish more visually appealing. You could sub in an Anaheim pepper for one of the bell peppers.
Onion: These taste great with either red or yellow onion. Red is a little more mild (plus I love the color it adds) but go with what you prefer.
Cilantro: If you love this flavor you can also add some to the marinade as well, just slide it off before cooking or it will just burn up.
Flour tortillas: I’m yet to find a brand that can come close competing with freshly made tortillas, but as of now my first choice of store-bought (pictured in ingredients image) is Guerrero which I do use as on occasion. Or I opt for corn tortillas which is the healthier option.
How to Make the Best Chicken Fajitas
Make the chicken fajita marinade by mixing together oil, lime, jalapeno, garlic, chili powder, cumin, salt and pepper.
Toss chicken in marinade in a bowl to coat evenly, rest in refrigerator 1 – 6 hours.
To cook chicken fajitas preheat a cast iron skillet. Remove chicken from marinade.
Cook chicken through in skillet, turning halfway. Transfer chicken to cutting board, rest and slice.
Meanwhile saute peppers and onions in same skillet to tender crisp texture.
Assemble chicken and veggie fajita mixture over tortillas and serve immediately.
Tips for the Skillet Fajitas
Use fresh ingredients.
Allow at least 1 hour to marinade for enough flavor absorption (to the exterior of the meat), don’t go beyond 6 hours though with chicken breasts or chicken texture can be altered.
For this recipe chicken thighs are best but if using chicken breasts use thinner portions, that’s why we halve them here. Otherwise they’d burn by the time they’ve cooked through.
Halving the chicken also allows for more surface area for better flavor penetration with the marinade.
Use a medium-high heat to get a nice char on the chicken, but if you notice it’s browning too quickly before the inside has a chance to cook through reduce the burner temp slightly as needed.
Don’t overcook the chicken breasts or they will be dry! Cook right to 160 – 165 degrees (in center).
Cook veggies to a tender crisp texture. They shouldn’t be crunchy but they shouldn’t be soft and mushy, just right in between.
How Can I Cook Chicken Fajitas on the Grill?
If going this route I much prefer boneless skinless chicken thighs since they char nicely and don’t dry out as easily, but chicken breasts work fine too. To grill:
Just use 4 (6 oz) boneless skinless chicken breasts or thighs, no halving necessary.
Marinate chicken as directed.
Preheat grill to medium-high heat.
Remove chicken from marinade.
Grill chicken until cooked through, about 4 minutes per side if using breasts, about 6 minutes per side if using thighs (as always test to proper temp).
Meanwhile, sauté the veggies in a large grill basket (with oil and seasonings), tossing occasionally until tender.
Or alternately the veggies can just be sautéed in a skillet while chicken grills.
How to Reheat Fajitas
Reheat in a skillet over medium-low heat, covered and stirring frequently until warmed through. Don’t overdue it or you can over-cook the chicken.
If reheating single servings you can reheat in the microwave on 50% power until heated through, tossing halfway through heating.
What Toppings are Best with Fajitas?
Traditionally fajitas aren’t really loaded with toppings but why not? Try some of these:
Guacamole or sliced avocado
Queso fresco or Monterey jack/pepper jack cheese
Homemade salsa or diced tomatoes
Mexican hot sauce
Sour cream or Mexican crema
What Sides Go Well with Fajitas?
Some classic Mexican side dishes are:
Refried beans
Black beans
Mexican rice
Mexican street corn (elote)

One of the best dinners out there! This easy recipe is made with deliciously seasoned, marinated and pan seared chicken, a trio of fresh bell peppers and tender crisp onions. Easy to make and unbelievably delicious!
Servings: 4
Prep20 minutes minutesCook15 minutes minutesMarinating2 hours hoursReady in: 2 hours hours 35 minutes minutes
Ingredients1 1/2 lbs trimmed chicken thighs or chicken breasts*5 Tbsp light olive oil divided4 Tbsp fresh lime juice, divided3 1/2 tsp minced garlic, divided2 1/2 tsp chili powder, divided2 tsp ground cumin, divided1 jalapeno, seeded for less heat if desired, minced1 1/4 tsp salt, more to taste1 tsp freshly ground black pepper3 medium bell peppers (preferably 1 red, yellow and green), seeded and sliced1 medium red onion or yellow onion, sliced3 Tbsp chopped fresh cilantro8 (7-inch) flour tortillas, warmed, homemade are best if time allowsOptional toppings, see notes
InstructionsIn a medium non-reactive mixing bowl (such as glass or stainless steel), whisk together 3 Tbsp olive oil, 3 Tbsp lime juice, 2 tsp garlic, 2 tsp chili powder, 1 1/2 tsp cumin, jalapeno, salt and pepper.Add chicken and toss well then submerge down into marinade. Cover and let marinate in refrigerator at least 1 hour and up to 6 hours.Preheat a 12-inch cast iron pan over medium-high heat. Add 1 Tbsp olive oil then place chicken in skillet leaving space between pieces and cook until well browned of first side about 4 to 6 minutes (chicken thighs take near greater time).Flip chicken and continue to cook until chicken registers 160 - 165 degrees on an instant read thermometer in center, about 4 to 6 minutes longer (chicken thighs take near greater time). If you find chicken is browning too quickly before cooking through you can reduce burner temperature slightly.Transfer chicken to a cutting board, tent with foil and let rest 5 minutes before slicing.Meanwhile, scrape up excess burnt bits from the skillet with a metal spatula if needed (you want some of those browned bits but not a lot of burnt black bits especially if you used thighs and had to cook longer). Add remaining 1 Tbsp oil to same cast iron skillet set over medium-high heat.Add bell peppers and onions, season with salt and pepper to taste. Saute about 4 minutes, only tossing occasionally and scraping up browned bits from the bottom of pan.Add remaining 1/2 tsp chili powder and 1/2 tsp cumin, 1 1/2 tsp garlic and saute until just tender crisp, about 2 minutes longer.** Pour in remaining 1 Tbsp lime juice and toss.Return chicken to pan, toss in cilantro and serve warm over tortillas with optional toppings.
Notes
*For chicken breasts you can use 4 (6 oz each) portions or 2 (12 oz each) portions halved through their thickness. Pound thicker areas of chicken breasts with the flat side of a meat mallet to even their thickness. For chicken thighs I recommend using about 4 oz. pieces, just trim the fat no flattening necessary.
**If you still have stubborn browned bits at the bottom of the pan you can help release them by pouring in a splash of chicken broth or water, these bits adds lots of flavor to the dish.
Nutrition estimate: based on two fajitas per person, using store-bought tortillas (homemade tortillas are about 50 calories extra each), and optional toppings not included.
To make them healthier use corn tortillas instead of flour. I like to warm corn tortillas in skillet in a teaspoon of olive oil until lightly golden brown spots appear on each side.
Topping Ideas (optional)
Guacamole or sliced avocado
Salsa or diced tomatoes
Sour cream or Mexican crema
Mexican hot sauce (such as Tapatio or Cholula)
Cheese - queso fresco, Monterey jack, pepper jack, or cheddar

Can I use anything in place of the lime juice? I don’t have any at home and don’t want to go the store. Could I use lemon juice or maybe some ac vinegar?

Lemon juice is a great substitute which I’ve used here just fine before. Enjoy!
