Creamy Pesto Pasta – Mini al dente pasta is coated in a luxurious sauce that’s speckled generously with minced fresh basil, infused with garlic and parmesan, and it’s completely easy to make. It’s like a fusion of creamy Alfredo sauce mingled with fresh pesto pasta and it’s undeniably delicious!
Crave-Worthy Pasta with Pesto Cream Sauce
While the recipe itself doesn’t have a typical pesto sauce in it, it brings the elements of pesto compiled together in a cooked pasta dish plus an addition of a gloriously creamy sauce.
I love a good pesto with a rich olive oil, but just think of a pesto made with silky cream instead. Once you taste this be wondering why you hadn’t made it this way before.
You only need a few ingredients to make this freshly flavorful dish. Plan on a simple prep, and if you want to upgrade it with a protein to make it heartier feel free to add one right into the pasta or pair alongside it.
Creamy Pesto Pasta Recipe Ingredients
Fresh basil: You’ll need a generous amount of basil when making this, so buy a few large bunches unless you have home grown garden fresh.
Extra virgin olive oil: Traditionally pesto has more olive oil than is used here but since there’s plenty of cream we cut it short on olive oil (and even add some water) so it’s not cloyingly heavy.
Farfalle: This is also known as bow tie pasta. I like to use the mini variety but the standard size will work fine too.
Garlic: A fair amount is used for vibrant flavor.
Heavy cream: Use a thick heavy cream for a thicker sauce that binds well. I recommend one that has a thickener added.
Parmesan cheese: For best flavor use the real deal, Parmigiano Reggiano from the big cheese wheels from Italy.
Salt and black pepper: Season to taste.
How to Make Creamy Pesto Pasta
Add basil leaves to a small or medium food processor along with 2 Tbsp olive oil and 2 Tbsp water.
Pulse until basil is very finely minced (stop and scrape down processor occasionally).
Transfer to a small airtight container and set aside (so it doesn’t brown).
Bring 10 cups water to a boil in a large pot. Season water with a fair amount of salt, add farfalle and cook according to times listed on package.
Reserve 1/2 cup pasta water then drain pasta.
Return empty pot to medium-low heat and add 1 Tbsp olive oil.
Add garlic and saute until fragrant and just barely deepening in color (but not browning), about 20 to 30 seconds.
Pour heavy cream and bring to a light simmer.
Stir in parmesan cheese, then add pasta and basil mixture, toss to evenly coat.
Season with salt and pepper to taste, thin with reserved pasta water as needed (it will thicken as it rests).
Storing and Reheating
Pasta can be stored in the fridge in an airtight container for up to 3 days.
Rewarm individual servings in the microwave on 50% power until warmed through.
Possible Variations
Pasta: Try this with another type of pasta such as rotini, mini shells, mini penne, campanelle, or orecchiette.
Protein: Add grilled or seared chicken breasts to the pasta. Cooked shrimp is another great option.
Store-bought pesto: If you don’t have an abundance of fresh basil you can make this with refrigerated store-bought pesto. Use 1/2 cup prepared pesto then reduce the heavy cream to 1/2 cup and the garlic to 2 tsp.
Helpful Tips for Pasta with Pesto Cream Sauce
Only use fresh basil in this recipe. It won’t have authentic pesto flavor without fresh basil and plenty of it.
Don’t forget to save pasta water as this is crucial for thinning the pasta sauce out. I’ve found it helpful to place a liquid measuring cup nearby the colander so I don’t forget to save some before I drain it.
Serve this pasta right away for best results. Similar to a cream based alfredo this sauce does thicken quickly as it rests so for that smooth, creamy consistency plan to serve shortly after prepared.
Season adequately with salt so the dish doesn’t taste flat. It’s also best to salt the pasta water so that salty flavor infuses into the pasta as it boils.

This looks delicious! I would love to make this for a party next weekend. Can you make this ahead and reheat?

The texture of the sauce isn’t quite the same when reheated but the pasta still tastes delicious. For best presentation and consistency I would recommend making it fresh.
