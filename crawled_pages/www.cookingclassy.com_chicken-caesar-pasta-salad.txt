Chicken Caesar Pasta Salad is a delicious blend of two incredible side dishes, pasta salad meets a traditional green salad. It’s brimming with vibrant flavor, has a satisfying blend of textures, and it’s sure to be a hit at your next summer get together!
Grilled Chicken Caesar Pasta Salad is made with tender penne pasta, lightly charred grilled chicken breasts, crisp romaine lettuce, sweet grape tomatoes, crunchy croutons, rich parmesan and it’s all covered in a creamy, lemony caesar salad dressing.
It’s a dish so filling and delicious that is could easily pasta for the main entree of a meal.
Plus it’s easy to make and there’s even a few shortcuts if you want to save some time, such as using rotisserie chicken, store-bought croutons, and even a store-bought caesar dressing (though I’d add some fresh lemon to it).
Or if you love to impress and go all out like I did here, which will create the very best pasta salad, then make the croutons from scratch, go for the grilled chicken option, and make the simple dressing fresh. This pasta salad is a dream and I think you’ll absolutely love it!
Chicken Caesar Pasta Salad Recipe Ingredients
For the dressing you’ll need:
Anchovies: Use canned anchovies in oil. Drain them before mincing and mashing to a paste.
Mayonnaise: I recommend using good quality mayonnaise such as Hellman’s/ Best Food’s for great flavor.
Lemon: Fresh lemon is a must here. Bottled just won’t be the same.
Parmesan cheese: I recommend real parmesan from the deli (such as Murray’s) that you’ve freshly grated with a rasp grater.
Dijon mustard: This is a bold ingredient which is why such a small amount is used so it doesn’t overpower.
Worcestershire sauce: This is another bold ingredient that really carries a flavor boost with just a little being added.
Garlic: Fresh garlic is best.
Salt and pepper: Season to taste.
For the salad you’ll need:
Penne pasta: Cook as directed on the package to al dente. You can use other types of pasta (see note below).
Romaine lettuce: I recommend using Romaine lettuce hearts as these are more crisp and will hold up better in the pasta salad as well.
Grilled chicken breasts: I have a marinating method I love to use for grilled chicken here.
Grape tomatoes: Cherry tomatoes will work here too.
Parsley: This ingredient actually isn’t a must, it can be omitted if you don’t have it. It just adds a little more fresh herby flavor.
Parmesan cheese: This sharp cheese is added to both the dressing and the salad for plenty of rich taste.
Croutons: I use this recipe here for homemade croutons (and you can freeze extra for longer shelf life). They are the best and it’s a great way to use up bread that’s going stale that might otherwise be discarded.
How to Make Chicken Caesar Pasta Salad
Cook the pasta: Cook pasta in salted water according to directions on package.
Reserve 1/2 cup pasta cooking water before draining and set aside to cool.
Drain pasta then transfer to an 18 by 13-inch rimmed baking sheet that’s sprayed with non-stick cooking spray or lined with parchment paper and let cool completely.
Make the caesar dressing: Mince anchovies and place in a medium mixing bowl, mash to a paste with the back of a spoon.
Add in mayonnaise, lemon juice, parmesan, dijon mustard, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, and salt and pepper to taste. Whisk to blend.
Chill in fridge until ready to use.
Add prepared salad ingredients to large bowl: Add cooled pasta, lettuce, chicken, tomatoes, and parsley to a large salad bowl.
Toss ingredients with dressing: Pour dressing over top and toss to evenly coat, thin mixture with pasta water as needed (it will thicken as it sits).
Finish with Croutons and Parmesan: Add croutons and parmesan and toss a few times incorporate.
Keep chilled.
Helpful Tips for the Best Grilled Chicken Caesar Pasta Salad
Let pasta and chicken cool completely: If you don’t let the pasta and chicken cool it will cook and wilt the lettuce and you’ll lose that beautiful crunch.
Serve shortly after preparing: Normally pasta salads keep well for days but this is one that’s best served within a few hours of preparing as the lettuce will start to wilt.
Use good quality ingredients: Collectively the freshest, high quality ingredients will create the best end result.
Cook pasta to al dente: This is so the pasta holds up well to tossing, it has a nice faint bite to it, and it will absorb some of the dressing taking on it’s flavor.
Frequently Asked Questions
Can I Make This Pasta Salad in Advance?
You can make the pasta salad in advance just wait to add the croutons and the lettuce. Also set aside 1/4 cup dressing (in the fridge) to toss with the lettuce before adding to the pasta salad.
And you can thin the pasta salad with a little water the next day before adding the lettuce and croutons.
Can I Use Another Type of Pasta?
Other types of bite size pasta will work great here as well. You can use bowtie pasta (farfalle), fusilli, rotini, campenelle, or orecchiette.
Will Rotisserie Chicken Work?
If you don’t have time to grill chicken a store-bought rotisserie chicken will work really well here too.
Can Chicken Thighs be Used?
Grilled chicken thighs are a great alternative to chicken breasts in this recipe.
How Can I Make the Dressing Healthier/Lighter?
If you want to make a lighter dressing try substituting plain Greek yogurt with 1 Tbsp olive oil. Reduce lemon to 2 Tbsp since it’s already quite tangy.

Susan Caesar
This is an exceptionally delicious salad and very forgiving. I have made this a couple of times now and just eyeballed the ingredient amounts after the first time making it. So so good. I had leftover asparagus and added that as well. Lots of wonderful flavors in this salad and very filling too. Please don’t skip making the homemade Caesar salad dressing as it truly is so gratifying!! Thank you, Jaclyn for sharing this recipe with us!!!
