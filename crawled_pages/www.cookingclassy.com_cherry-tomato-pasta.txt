Bright and fresh Cherry Tomato Pasta! Made with an abundance of sweet cherry tomatoes, highly aromatic fresh basil, rich silky olive oil, and a just enough bold garlic and parmesan cheese. This is without a doubt one of the best ways to use up those seasonally prime, mini summer tomatoes!
Burst Cherry Tomato Pasta Sauce
This Italian tomato sauce is unbelievably easy to make, so easy in fact you you don’t even have to start by cutting tomatoes they are just added whole. A quick simmer on the stove will have the skins bursting and they’ll simmer down to a thick sauce.
The sauce is ready in 15 minutes and you can have the pasta cooking while the sauce is simmering for a super fast meal. For a quick cooking pasta try it with cheese filled tortellini!
You’ll find this to be a vegetarian dish that’s sure to please everyone especially if you opt to crown individual servings with those creamy finishing touches. That includes either moisture rich fresh mozzarella (mini pearls are great), dollops of milky ricotta, or torn portions of cream filled burrata.
This is a must try summer recipe that’s brimming with freshness and sure to satisfy those pasta cravings!
Cherry Tomato Pasta Recipe Ingredients
Pasta: I like to use spaghetti or linguine but other types such as penne, farfalle, campanelle, rotini, fusilli would be other good options.
Extra virgin olive oil: Use good quality olive oil since a fair amount is being used and the flavor will stand out.
Cherry tomatoes: You can use all red cherry tomatoes or a blend of red, orange and yellow.
Garlic: Only use fresh garlic in this dish.
Red pepper flakes: If you don’t want a faintly spicy sauce you can omit these, for a spicier sauce use more red pepper flakes.
Sugar: This ingredient is optional and as needed and will really just depend on the batch of cherry tomatoes being used. Some garden fresh cherry tomatoes are quite sweet while other store-bought are more tart so taste the sauce and add sugar if needed. You could use honey here if preferred as well.
Fresh basil: A critical ingredient to the sauce. Only use fresh basil not dried for authentic Italian flavor.
Parmesan cheese: Use aged Parmegiano Reggiano. Some is added to the sauce while more will be used for serving.
Optional toppings: You can serve with just the sauce but excellent additions for more indulgence include ricotta, burrata or fresh mozzarella.
Begin by Preparing Pasta
Bring about 3 quarts salted boiling water to a boil in a large pot.
Cook to al dente according to time listed on package.
Reserve 1/2 cup pasta water before draining pasta.
While pasta cooks prepare the sauce.
How to Cook Cherry Tomatoes for Pasta
Heat olive oil in a 12-inch saute pan or pot over medium heat.
Add tomatoes and saute 2 minutes. Add garlic and red pepper flakes then saute 3 minutes longer.
Now start to break down some of the tomatoes with the back of a wooden spoon.
Season sauce with salt and pepper to taste and simmer over medium-low heat until most of the cherry tomatoes have burst, about 5 minutes longer.
Reduce heat to low, stir in parmesan cheese. Then add drained pasta, 1/4 cup pasta water, and 1/4 cup of the basil. Toss and warm together for about 1 minute. Thin with more pasta water as needed.
Plate and garnish with remaining 1/4 cup basil and more parmesan cheese to taste. If desired serve with dollops of ricotta, or fresh mozzarella, or burrata cheese.
Helpful Tips for the Best Cherry Tomato Sauce
Using quality tomatoes: Use garden fresh tomatoes (home grown or from the farmers market) if possible, or the best you can find at the local grocery store.
Seasonal summer tomatoes will be best.
Finish cooking pasta with sauce: Cook pasta just barely to al dente for the best texture then simmer briefly with the sauce so it soaks up some of the flavor.
Don’t forget the pasta water: The starchy pasta water is almost always an excellent finishing touch to a good pasta dish. The starches in it help thicken the sauce, while the liquid loosens a sauce base yielding a dish with the perfect consistency.
Add parmesan cheese: For an extra boost in flavor I recommend adding some parmesan right to the sauce. Grate it fine with a rasp grater (zester) and it melts quickly and smoothly into the sauce.
Possible Variations
Try other types of tomatoes: Grape tomatoes will work well here too (I would recommend the larger ones not the petites so there aren’t too many tomato skins in the dish.
Add meat: For a meaty sauce add cooked Italian sausage, ground beef, ground pork, or shrimp.
Add more herbs: For an herbier sauce try it with a handful of fresh parsley in addition to the basil.
Use other types of pasta: Try this with various cuts of pasta and pick your favorite. And if you can find it local, or have the patience to make it, fresh pasta would be the absolute best!
Serve over tortellini: If you want a cheesy upgrade try this sauce tossed with cheese filled tortellini (the spinach and meat varieties would be delicious as well).
How to Store and Reheat
Store cherry tomato sauce in the fridge in an airtight container for up to 4 days.
Reheat in a saute pan or in a pot on the stove. Thin the sauce with vegetable broth as it warms.
Toss with freshly cooked pasta once heated through.
While the sauce could be frozen I don’t recommend it at it would lose so much of it’s fresh tasting goodness. This type of sauce is best served within a few days of preparing.

This is fantastic! I made it exactly as written except I cut the recipe in half for just me and my hubby. It’s so delicious and simple. The true compliment is that my meat loving hubby was totally fine with this pasta dish all by itself. Truly enjoyed this one!
