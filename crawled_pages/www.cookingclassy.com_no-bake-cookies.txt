No Bake Cookies are such a nostalgic childhood favorite! This recipe has that classic chocolate peanut butter flavor combo and the perfect chewy, fudgy texture. And I’m pretty sure they’re the easiest cookies on the planet to make!
Easy No Bake Cookies
I’ve been making no bake oatmeal cookies for as long as I can remember. It’s one of the first things I learned how to make as a kid, I’d make them for my family on the weekends because my mom didn’t care much for dessert (be sure to supervise kids when making these though!).

They always filled the craving for something sweet and they were ready to eat in no time. Plus everyone in my family loved them, and me the most I’m sure.
Chocolate and Peanut Butter Flavors
This is almost the exact same recipe I had when I was younger but I did add in a little bit more cocoa and peanut butter here, because why not?? It’s a flavor combo I never can resist!
Ingredients You’ll Need for This Recipe
Sugar
Butter
Milk
Unsweetened cocoa powder
Vanilla
Quick oats
Peanut butter
How to Make No Bake Cookies
First line two baking sheets with parchment paper (or just spread a long sheet of the parchment onto the counter), or have 29 cupcake liners set out.
Then in a 2.5 – 3 quart saucepan combine sugar, butter, cocoa powder and milk.
Set saucepan over medium heat (I like to use the largest burner on the stove) and begin whisking. Cook and whisk frequently until it reaches a boil, then once it reaches a full boil stop stirring and let it boil for 1 minute.
Remove the mixture from heat then immediately add in vanilla, peanut butter and oatmeal. And stir to blend well.
Drop mixture onto prepared parchment dropping 2 Tbsp at a time (a medium cookie scoop works well here or just use two large spoons).
Let cookies set then enjoy! If you want to speed up setting transfer to refrigerator. Store the cookies at room temp in an airtight container.
Tips for No Bake Oatmeal Cookies
After 20 some odd years of making these I’ve learned a few things along the way.
Don’t just bring the mixture to a simmer (where the edges of the mixture bubbles up) it needs to start fully boiling (bubbling up in the middle) before counting down those 60 seconds.
Don’t use old fashioned oats, I think quick oats are a must. The cookies won’t set up quite the same and they won’t be as tender.
The recipe should hopefully turn out perfect for you but if they’re a bit too wet, boil 15 seconds longer the next time, if they came out dry, boil 15 seconds under. The amount of time the liquid is boiled will determine the way the cookies set up and also determines how moist they’ll be.
I prefer creamy peanut butter but if you like the crunch of crunchy peanut butter you can use that here, just add an extra 1/4 cup so the consistency isn’t affected.
Use real butter, never margarine. It has a bad flavor which will affect the flavor of the cookies and it has added water so your end result won’t be as good.
Then as listed in the recipe stick with the bit of extra cocoa and peanut butter, it makes them a bit richer than you remember. I also cut back on the sugar by 1/4 cup as is listed in the recipe.
What do You Call Them?
When I was a kid we actually called these “uncooked cookies” which is funny because they are still cooked. But now I’m thinking maybe they should be called “summer cookies” because there’s just those days when we want a cookie but it’s so hot no one wants to turn the oven on, right?
Of course we’ll still stick with No Bake Cookies. But no matter what you call these decadent treats everyone will always love them!

I am 73 years old and grew up on these cookies and made them for my children. I was raised in W.KY on a small farm. We called them chocolate oatmeal cookies because it was the only oatmeal cookie we made until I was an adult and found a recipe in a newspaper for oatmeal cookies made with fresh apples and honey. I lost that recipe and so wish I had it. This cookie was a staple at our house. This is the exact same recipe we used and the instructions are perfect.

Ms. Wanda, here is one you might like. 2 cups old fashioned oats: 3/4 cup all purpose flour: 1/2 tsp. baking soda: 1 tsp.ground cinnamon: 1/4 tsp. salt: 1/2 cup applesauce unsweetened: 1/2 cup butter room temperature: 1 tsp. vanilla extract: 2/3 cup brown sugar or honey: 1 medium apple peeled and finely diced.
In a medium skillet, melt one tablespoon of the butter and add the diced apples. Cook for approximately 4-5 minutes until apples get a little soft. 2. In a medium bowl, mix the oats, flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt together. 3. In a separate large bowl, beat the remaining butter, applesauce, brown sugar and vanilla extract together. 4. Add in the flour mixture to the wet ingredients, stirring just until just blended 5. Fold in the diced cooked apple. 6. Place in the refrigerator and chill for 10 minutes 7. Preheat the oven to 350° F 8. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. 9. Drop the cookie dough onto the baking sheet and flatten slightly. 10. Bake for 15 minutes until golden brown 11. Cool on the pan for about 2-3 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
This isn’t my recipe, but, it is a decent one to try.
