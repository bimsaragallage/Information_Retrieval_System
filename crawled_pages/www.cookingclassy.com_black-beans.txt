Once you try these homemade Black Beans you’ll never look at canned the same! These are so flavorful, easy to prepare and they are they make the perfect side dish. Plus they freeze well and reheat well too.
Black Beans
These are just like the black beans you get as a side dish at Mexican restaurants. They’re healthy, so tasty, and they’re the perfect accompaniment to your Mexican main dishes.
You can also make them part of the main dish. Drain them well and add to tacos, enchiladas, salads, nachos and so forth.
What Ingredients do I Need for Homemade Black Beans?
2 Tbsp olive oil
1 1/2 cups chopped yellow onion
1 medium red bell pepper, chopped
1 medium jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced (optional)
2 Tbsp minced garlic (6 cloves)
3 cups low-sodium chicken broth
3 cups water
1 lb dry black beans, rinsed well and drained
1 1/2 tsp ground cumin
1 tsp Mexican oregano
Salt and freshly ground black pepper

How to Make Black Beans in the Slow Cooker
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
Add onion, bell pepper and jalapeno and saute 2 minutes. Add garlic and saute 1 minute longer. (Note that I used half a green bell pepper here but the color gets mucky so stick with red.)
Pour mixture into a 5 – 7 quart slow cooker. Add chicken broth, water, black beans, oregano, cumin and season with salt and pepper to taste.
Cover and cook on high heat for 4 to 4 1/2 hours until beans are soft.
How to Make Black Beans in the Instant Pot
Select the “saute” mode on the instant pot. Once the label reads “hot” drizzle in olive oil.
Add in onion, bell pepper and jalapeno and saute 2 minutes. Add garlic and saute 1 minute longer. Press “cancel” on the instant pot.
Pour in chicken broth, water, black beans, oregano and cumin and season with salt and pepper to taste.
Seal instant pot with lid and make sure valve is set to “sealing” position. Select “manual mode” and set to 36 minutes.
Once time is up let pressure come down naturally for 10 minutes then quick release any remaining pressure.
Strain Some of Excess Liquid
I like to drain off most of the excess liquid or just use a slotted spoon to serve.
Optional Toppings
If desired top the beans with cheese (crumbled queso fresco or shredded cheddar are good choices), cilantro and spritz with lime. If you like them a little richer you can drizzle with olive oil.
What Should I Serve with These?

Love this recipe! Added some dried cilantro with the spices and sautéed the veggies with Goya Recaito in addition to the EVOO. Used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth to make vegan.  Delicious!!

This  is the most successful and flavorful black bean recipe I have tried in my slow cooker in the past 5 years!  I was a bit skeptical that 4 hrs on high would cook them enough, but they came out just with just the right firm but soft texture.  And the flavor was great!  I found any reason to include them in a meal, with rice or other grains.  I was so impressed that I raved about them to my daughter and I am now about to share the recipe with her.  These black beans are sure to become a staple in my cooking repertoire.

Not very flavorful, so much water and broth left over, seems like a huge waste.

Sorry you felt that way. Most bean recipes do call for a fair amount of liquid otherwise you may end up with stiff beans that haven’t cooked through fully if they aren’t covered in liquid while cooking. And as far as flavor goes you can definitely increase spices or add additional spices to taste for an extra boost of flavor.
