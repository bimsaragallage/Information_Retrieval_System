Healthy Vegetarian Chili is jam-packed with fresh nutritious veggies, two types of beans, and it’s all simmered in a deeply spiced tomato base. It’s a delicious stew-like soup, ideal for those chilly autumn and winter days and it’s so tasty served with homemade cornbread.
Easy Vegetarian Chili
You’ll love that this is a vegetable chili you can feel great about eating and feeding the family, and it doesn’t taste too much different than a meat-heavy chili thanks to all those flavorful Mexican spices.
It comes together quickly, it’s just a bit of chopping and has a fairly short simmer time compared to that of traditional chili. It’s hearty and filling thanks to the beans and fiber rich vegetables and it’s still a great base for piling on all the best chili toppings.
We love it with avocado, cheese, and sour cream atop but if you if you want to make this a vegan chili then opt for a vegan cheese and sour cream, or just omit them both altogether.

Olive oil
Fresh vegetables: bell pepper, yellow onion, carrots, garlic, zucchini, jalapeno

Frequently Asked Questions
What to serve with vegetarian chili
Skillet cornbead
No knead bread or one hour bread
Baked sweet potato fries or baked sweet potatoes
Tortilla chips
Saltine crackers or oyster crackers
Can it be made in a slow cooker?
To make vegetarian chili in a crockpot simply cook ingredients in a slow cooker on low heat for about 5 hours, or on high for 2 1/2 hours.
If doing so finely chop the yellow onion so it ends up tender.
You can add the beans in the beginning if you like them soft, otherwise wait to add during the last 15 minutes.
How long does it last in the fridge?
Vegetable chili will keep in the fridge for 4 days.
Store it in an airtight container.
Can it be frozen?
Yes vegetarian chili freezes really well for 3 months.
When freezing allow about 1-inch at the top of the container for the soup to expand once frozen so the container doesn’t break.
Helpful Tips for the Best Vegetarian Chili
Always use a variety of vegetables for nutrition and to build up flavor.
Saute firm vegetables first and wait to add soft vegetables so they don’t get mushy.
Bloom the spices, that is to saute them first to bring out their flavor.
Simmer everything together so the flavors have a chance to meld.

Very hearty and tasty. It looks like soup but tastes like chili. This recipe makes quite a lot, so I am going to try to freeze some. I will definitely make this again.

I’m a recipe and nutritional info noob. How do you know how much is in a serving size? I see it makes 7 servings… but is there an easy way to determine the portion size? Thanks

Sorry I forgot to measure total volume. But I’ve found the easiest method is to use the largest liquid measuring cup I’ve got to measure total yield.
