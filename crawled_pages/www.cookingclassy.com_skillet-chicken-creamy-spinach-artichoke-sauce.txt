Creamy spinach artichoke chicken has all the flavors of spinach artichoke dip, wrapped up in a delicious and easy chicken dinner. Juicy pan-seared chicken breasts are nestled in a mouthwatering cream sauce with heaps of cheese, briny artichokes, and savory spinach. It’s a quick comfort food dinner that you’ll be craving until the next time you make it. The cherry on top? Everything cooks in the same pan, so clean-up is extra easy. Winner, winner, chicken dinner!
Why You’ll Love This Creamy Spinach Artichoke Chicken Recipe
One pan. You cook the chicken and the sauce all in one skillet. Pan-searing gets the chicken perfectly golden brown, and the leftover bits get stirred right into the sauce for flavor.
Extra creamy. The hearty homemade cream sauce is a cross between your favorite cheesy Alfredo sauce and a decadent spinach and artichoke dip. It’s rich and ultra-creamy, perfect for smothering the chicken and serving with pasta, rice, or bread.
Weeknight-ready. You’ll love that this spinach artichoke chicken is quick to make and perfect for weeknights. The indulgent flavors also make it fancy enough to wow guests at your next dinner party.
Ingredients You’ll Need
I’ve included some notes on the important ingredients here. Scroll down to the recipe card after the post for a printable list with amounts.
Chicken – I use boneless, skinless chicken breasts for this recipe. You can also use boneless chicken thighs if you prefer. Keep in mind that thighs take slightly longer to cook.
Olive oil – Extra virgin olive oil for sauteing. You can also use another kind of cooking oil, like avocado oil or canola.
Butter and flour – You’ll combine the two to make what’s called a roux, used to thicken the cream sauce.
Seasonings – Fresh garlic, salt, and black pepper. I like to give the finished dish a sprinkle with crushed red pepper flakes for kick, but that’s optional.
Spinach – You can use fresh or frozen spinach, see below.
Artichoke hearts – Canned artichokes work great here. You can buy them whole or in quarters. Drain them before chopping.
Cheese – there’s a pairing of mild and sharp flavors of Neufchatel cheese and grated parmesan in this recipe. Neufchatel is a soft, tangy, creamy cheese while parmesan is sharp and bold. If you can’t find it where you are, cream cheese is a good substitute.
Sour Cream – This is another addition that creates a silky, creamy sauce with more flavor.
Can I Use Frozen Spinach?
Definitely! If you’re using frozen spinach instead of fresh spinach, you’ll need to thaw and drain it first. I recommend pressing the drained spinach between paper towels to squeeze out as much moisture as possible. Add it to the recipe at the same time that you would add the fresh spinach.
How to Make Spinach Artichoke Chicken
You’re going to love how easily this spinach artichoke chicken comes together in one pan. Follow the step-by-step below, and scroll to the recipe card for printable instructions.
Prep the chicken. Start by pounding the chicken breasts to an even thickness using a meat mallet. This way, the chicken cooks evenly. Afterward, season both sides of the chicken with salt and pepper.
Cook. Sear the chicken in a large skillet over medium-high heat, until it’s browned on both sides and cooked through. Keep the chicken covered under foil while you prepare your sauce.
Make the sauce. Use the same skillet that you used to cook the chicken. Melt butter, then stir in garlic and flour. Add the spinach and artichokes, followed by the milk. Use a spatula or wooden spoon to scrape the stuck-on bits from the bottom of the pan.
Add cheese. To finish the sauce, melt in both cheeses and season to taste. Once the sauce has thickened, stir in the sour cream.
Combine and serve. Nestle the chicken into the sauce. Finally, sprinkle with red pepper flakes, and serve!
Tips for Success
You just can’t go wrong with juicy skillet chicken and a good sauce. Follow these tips for spinach and artichoke chicken that’s cooked to perfection every time:
Pound the chicken flat. Similar to chicken piccata, pounding the thick ends of the chicken breasts flat helps the chicken cook quickly and evenly in the pan.
Check the chicken for doneness. Chicken is cooked when the internal temperature reaches 165ºF. The easiest way to check is with an instant-read thermometer.
Can I use chicken thighs? Yes, chicken thighs work in this recipe. Unlike chicken breasts, you won’t need to pound chicken thighs flat beforehand. The cooking time might vary, so be sure to check that your chicken is done (see above).
Use different cheese. As mentioned earlier, feel free to substitute tangy Neufchatel cheese with something milder, like cream cheese. You can also replace the parmesan cheese with Pecorino Romano or asiago cheese.
What to Serve With Spinach and Artichoke Chicken
Rich, saucy recipes like this spinach artichoke chicken call for slices of crusty bread or fluffy dinner rolls to sop up all that leftover sauce. It’s also delicious served over garlic butter rice or lemon couscous, or you can make spinach artichoke chicken pasta served over your favorite noodles.
I like to round out the meal with a side of glazed carrots, easy sauteed green beans, or grilled veggies. For something a little lighter, you can’t go wrong with a fresh green salad!
Storing and Reheating Leftover Chicken
Refrigerate. Store any leftover spinach artichoke chicken in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 4 days. Due to the cream sauce, I don’t recommend freezing.
Reheat. This chicken reheats well. Warm servings in the microwave or a skillet on the stovetop. If you feel that the sauce has thickened, sprinkle in a little milk or water to help thin it out again.

This was amazing! I don’t have access to Neufchâtel so I used mozzarella instead and I will definitely be making this again.
