The tastiest Black Bean Soup! Itâ€™s a hearty, nutritious soup made with plenty of black beans, a fair amount of veggies, plus bacon for a boost of flavor, and lots of satisfying toppings. This soup is an easy, delicious way to upgrade those otherwise boring and plain canned black beans.
Easy Black Bean Soup
This black bean soup is a must try soup recipe! Sure it may sound meh if youâ€™ve never had it but trust me, if you flavor it right it can become a crave-worthy soup.
Here we add rich bacon, vibrant bell pepper or poblano peppers, fire roasted tomatoes, earthy seasonings including cumin and ancho chili powder and it takes basic bland black beans to an exciting new level.
And letâ€™s not forget to mention those highlighting finishes. Bright fresh lime juice, herby cilantro, creamy avocados and sour cream, and always cheese (cheddar, queso fresco or feta are great).
This may just become a new favorite black bean recipe for you!
Black Bean Soup Recipe Ingredients and Substitutes
Canned black beans: Pinto beans could be a tasty alternative.
Bacon: Chorizo would be a nice meaty substitute for bacon.
Yellow onion: Red or white onion can be use here as well.
Pepper: Bell pepper, poblano pepper or even a few jalapenos for a spicy soup will work here.
Garlic: I recommend fresh garlic for the most flavor but in a pinch 1 tsp dried can be used.
Low-sodium chicken broth: If you have homemade stock that will make the soup even better. Vegetable broth can be substituted.
Canned fire roasted tomatoes: Fresh roasted roma tomatoes are another option.
Ground cumin and chili powder: Ground coriander and ancho chili powder will work too.
Fresh lime: Lemon would be very similar.
Cilantro: Parsley can be used if you have an aversion to cilantro.
Salt and black pepper
What are the Best Toppings for Black Bean Soup?

How to Make Black Bean Soup
1. Place 1 1/2 cans of drained black beans in a food processor along with 1/2 cup of the chicken broth and pulse until well pureed.
2. Rinse remaining 2 1/2 cans of black beans in a colander. Set all black beans aside.
3. Heat a large pot over medium heat. Add bacon and cook until crisp, tossing occasionally. Transfer bacon to a paper towel lined plate leaving rendered bacon fat in pot.
4. Add in onions and bell pepper or poblano pepper to pot and saute 3 minutes then add garlic, chili powder and cumin and saute 1 minute longer.
5. Pour in remaining chicken broth (3 cups) black beans, black bean puree mixture, fire roasted tomatoes, and season with salt and pepper to taste.
6. Bring to a boil then reduce heat to medium-low, cover and simmer 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.
7. Stir cooked bacon, lime juice and cilantro and serve warm with desired toppings.
Storage
Black bean soup will keep in the fridge for 4 to 5 days.
Store it in an airtight container once cooled slightly.
It can also be frozen for up to 3 months.
What to Serve with Black Bean Soup
Tortilla Chips and Salsa
Corn Salsa
Guacamole
Cilantro Lime Rice
Quesadillas
Homemade tortillas
Can It be Made Vegan?
If you want to make this vegan omit the bacon, replace with soy chorizo (use oil to cook it).
Omit dairy toppings and replace with vegan alternatives (vegan cheese, vegan sour cream).
Use vegetable broth in place of chicken broth.

Can you do this in a slow cooker? Iâ€™m disabled and cooking is difficult for me.
Thank you.

Iâ€™m sorry to hear this. You could also do it in a slow cooker just cook the bacon separately or buy pre-cooked bacon. Mince the onion small in a food processor if youâ€™ve got one so it will get tender.
