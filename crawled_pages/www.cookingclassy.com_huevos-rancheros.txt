Flavorful and hearty Huevos Rancheros – A deliciously scrumptious Mexican breakfast made with fresh ingredients, served warm and cozy, and sure to satisfy those bright spicy cravings. You’ll have these devoured in minutes!
What are Huevos Rancheros?
Huevos Rancheros is a traditional Mexican dish made up of warmed corn tortillas, a cooked salsa (red tomato salsa or green tomatillo salsa), and fried eggs. It is pronounced way-vows-rhan-che-rohs and translates meaning rancher’s eggs.
They are frequently served with refried beans or black beans on top or as a side, and you can garnish them with various toppings.
This version is easy to prepare and is fairly quick compared to other versions. That is thanks to a food processor, because we skip the option of roasting the tomatoes and veggies for speed (though there’s no lack in fresh flavor), and here  the recipe calls for ground chili powder rather than managing the steps of whole dried peppers.
This Huevos Rancheros is practically perfect and such a welcome comforting way to start the day. You may even likely find you are craving it for not only breakfast but lunch or dinner too!
Make it a complete meal served with chorizo or sausage, and don’t forget that side of beans.
Huevos Rancheros Recipe Ingredients
Tomatoes: I like to use a blend of 1 lb Roma tomatoes and 1 lb vine ripened because the Roma’s are sweet and the vine ripened are juicy.
Canned chipotle chiles: Traditionally you may find serrano or jalapeno peppers are used but I love the smokiness of the chipotle peppers and the way they pair with the eggs. They are spice so adjust amount according to your preference.
Olive oil: Traditionally vegetable oil is used but olive oil is a healthier option.
Yellow onion: You may subsistute white or red onion here as well.
Salt and black pepper: Season the sauce and eggs to taste.
Garlic: Use fresh garlic cloves for the best flavor.
Chili powder: regular chili powder, ancho chili powder or New Mexican chili powder are all good choices, or use a blend.
Cilantro: Fresh cilantro is far superior to dried and highly recommended here.
Corn tortillas: These are the base to the huevos rancheros to hold the eggs and salsa. Use traditional taco size tortillas for this recipe.
Eggs: These are must have ingredient for the dish. How you cook them can be up to you, though fried are typical.
Toppings: Additional toppings are optional but highly recommended. Avocado, cheese, black beans or refried beans are tasty options served with these.
How to Make Huevos Rancheros
Make the Salsa
Place half of the tomatoes in a food processor along with all of the chipotle peppers. Process in 1-second bursts until minced.
Pour into a bowl and repeat with remaining tomatoes, then pour into same bowl.
Heat 1 Tbsp olive oil in a 12-inch non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add onion and saute until tender, about 5 minutes.
Add garlic and chili powder and saute 30 seconds longer.
Pour tomato mixture in with onion mixture in skillet. Reduce heat to medium-low, season with salt and pepper to taste and simmer until slightly thickened, about 6 to 8 minutes.
Stir in cilantro.
You can serve the salsa chunky or transfer to a blender and pulse until it’s finer and more pureed. Set salsa aside.
Fry the Tortillas
Set clean 12-inch non-stick skillet heat over medium heat, add 2 tsp oil and cook 2 to 3 tortillas at a time, cooking until golden brown spots appear.
Transfer tortillas to paper towels to drain (I just stack one then fold paper towel an repeat this also keeps them warmer stacked). Repeat with remaining tortillas.
Fry the Eggs
Return skillet to medium heat, coat with 1 1/2 tsp oil or spray inside evenly with cooking spray. Add 1 egg at a time spacing evenly apart near the edges of pan, cook 4 eggs at once.
Season each egg with salt and pepper to taste and fry 2 minutes, then cover pan with lid and and cook until whites are set but yolks are still runny, about 1 to 2 minutes longer.
Tip: You can also add 1 Tbsp water for added steam and more even cooking when covered.
Assemble the Huevos Rancheros
Plate one tortilla, a heaped spoonful of salsa over tortilla then top with one fried egg.
Add desired toppings.
Helpful Tips
Eggs: If you don’t like runny fried eggs simply flip them over and continue to cook until the yolk is more firm, you can even pierce it to speed up the cooking process. Another option is to use poached or scrambled eggs in the recipe.
Roast produce: For deeper, lightly charred flavor you can broil the tomatoes and onion before using in the recipe just until blackened in spots on a baking sheet.
Toppings: While these are intended to be basic and simple extra toppings are always welcome for more flavor. The avocado and cheese always make them that much better, and you can use various types of cheese it doesn’t have to be cotija.
Storage
If possible the eggs are best served freshly made but if you happen to have leftover fried eggs they can be stored in the fridge in an airtight container for 3 days and rewarmed in a skillet.
The salsa can be stored in the fridge for up to 5 days and reheated in the microwave. Thin with a little water as needed.
Frequently Asked Questions
Can I Use Canned Tomatoes?
This recipe will also work with 2 (14.5 oz) cans of diced tomatoes in place of fresh. Fresh are best here but when it’s hard to get good quality fresh tomatoes canned is the next best option.
Will Flour Tortillas Work in Place of Corn Tortillas?
Though not traditional flour tortillas could be used in this recipe as well. I would however suggest making them a bit crisp in cooking oil.
How do You Make Huevos Rancheros Verdes?
Prepare tortillas and eggs as directed, serve with this Salsa Verde recipe in place of tomato salsa.
What Can I Do with Extra Salsa?
If you happen to have extra ranchera salsa or salsa verde just serve it atop tacos. Chicken Street Tacos or Barbacoa Beef Tacos are a great option.
