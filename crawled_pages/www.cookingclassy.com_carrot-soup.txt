Nutritious Carrot Soup – Made with an abundance of fresh vitamin rich carrots, earthy spices, creamy coconut milk, and a hint of ginger, honey, and lemon to boost flavor. A great way to use up all those carrots in the fridge!
Healthy Carrot Soup
Though this gingery carrot soup recipe may seem ideal for spring it’s actually an excellent soup to serve any time of year because you can almost always get good quality carrots at the store year round. And they are a staple food most of us keep stocked in the fridge.
This soup has such a delicious inviting flavor between it’s sweet carrot goodness, the bright ginger and garlic, a light background spice boost, and the richness of the coconut milk.
It’s a vegan soup but can also be adapted to use what you have on hand if you don’t intend to make it vegan. Ingredients such as chicken broth, and half and half or heavy cream can be used.
Guests will love it as an appetizer for dinner, or serve it as a main course at lunch with whole grain bread or no knead homemade bread (great for dipping of course), or a grilled cheese sandwich.
Carrot Soup Recipe Ingredients
Olive oil
Fresh veggies: Carrots, yellow onion, celery, garlic, ginger, parsley (optional)
Spices: Paprika, cumin, nutmeg, cayenne pepper, salt and black pepper
Sweetener: Honey or maple syrup (maple syrup for vegan)
Liquids: Vegetable broth, coconut milk, lemon juice
How to Make Carrot Soup
1. Saute vegetables: Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add carrots, onion and celery and saute 10 minutes.
2. Bloom seasonings: Add ginger, garlic, paprika, cumin, nutmeg, and cayenne pepper and saute 2 minutes longer.
3. Add broth, simmer: Pour in 6 cups vegetable broth, season with salt and pepper to taste and bring soup to a boil. Cover and reduce heat to medium-low. Cook until carrots are very tender, about 20 minutes, stirring once halfway through.
4. Puree soup: Remove from heat and puree mixture with an immersion blender. Stir in up to 1 more cup of broth as desired (rewarm soup through if needed).
5. Add finishing flavors: Stir in coconut milk, honey and lemon juice or swirl coconut milk into individual servings.
6. Garnish: Serve warm garnishing servings with parsley if desired.
How to Puree Soup without an Immersion Blender
This soup can also be made using a regular high speed blender to blend it up.
You’ll just have to process the soup in batches in the blender.
Don’t fill blender more than halfway full, cover with lid while remove the lids center insert and cover that with layers of rolled up paper towel or a kitchen cloth when processing.
If you don’t own either an immersion blender or high speed blender (and if you don’t mind a chunky texture) then just mash the soup with a potato masher upon completion.
Storage and Reheating
Fridge: Carrot soup can be stored in the fridge for 3 days in an airtight container.
Freezer: It can be frozen for up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in the fridge before reheating.
Rewarming: Reheat on the stovetop in a pot over medium heat, covered, stirring occasionally. Or rewarm individual servings in the microwave.
